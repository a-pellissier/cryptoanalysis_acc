Binance Coin was launched as an<a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/erc-20\"> ERC-20 token</a> sold through an<a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/initial-coin-offering-ico\"> initial coin offering (ICO)</a> to be used for discounted trading fees, of which a portion are burned each quarter. Once Binance launched Binance Chain, its own public blockchain in April 2019, the ERC-20 tokens were swapped for native tokens. On top of Binance Chain, the team built a <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-exchanges\">decentralized exchange</a> known as Binance DEX allowing traders to maintain custody of their funds. Over time, additional utility has been added to the token such as use in the Binance Launchpad lottery system and various payments in the Binance ecosystem. In addition, according to their CEO Changpeng Zhao (\"CZ\") 90% of Binance employees choose to receive part of their salary in BNB.',\n",

These discounts are at the sole discretion of Binance and could be altered at any time.  \\n\\nLaunchpad\\nAs a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-evolution-of-crypto-capital-markets\">progression </a>of the ICO, Binance first popularized the <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/initial-exchange-offering-ieo\">initial exchange offering (IEO)</a> when they announced in January 2019 that they would be selling tokens directly through the exchange every month. Initially, the sales were done on a first come first serve basis. They since pivoted to a lottery system where users can claim tickets based on the number of BNB tokens held over the prior 20 days. The tickets represent a certain allocation of tokens and are drawn randomly. If selected, the user is committed to purchasing that number of tokens at the listed price. \\n\\nBinance Chain\\nBNB acts as the native token used as gas to pay for network transactions on Binance Chain, a high-performance blockchain network. It initially operates with a small pre-selected validator set, but the plan is to transition to a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/delegated-proof-of-stake\">delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS)</a> consensus mechanism where users can vote using their BNB for delegates that will validate blocks to secure the network.

As a result, the team allocation, that was initially supposed to be vesting for 4 years, will remain illiquid until all 80,000,000 BNB have been burnt.
